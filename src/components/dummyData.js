            Math: Practice is key! Solve as many problems as you can from your
            textbook and old tests. Try to understand the ideas, not just
            memorize them. Textbook work is your best friend.
            <br />
            English: Read your assigned book(s) well. Take notes and think about
            the characters storylines and main ideas. Don’t focus on nitty
            gritty details. Practice writing essays with PEEL structure!
            <br />
            Science: Use pictures and diagrams! Make flashcards and drawings to
            help you understand and quiz yourself with those. Also, watch videos
            or look online for more help to understand the concept rather than
            memorize it. Explain the topics to your friends to further ingrain
            it into your brain.
            <br />
            French : Practice speaking and listening! Talk with friends or use
            apps to practice. Review new words regularly. Try and converse with
            your friends in French regularly and my favorite tip is to watch
            French movies with French subtitles.

We want clients and designers alike to think about their design and how it will work with the web copy, we want you think about how numbers, symbols and bullet points will look. Sure, it's easier to just run down the forms and fill the fields with garbage in order to plow through them quickly. But that's not real. That's not what your customers are going to do. Is it really smart to take a shortcut when customers are forced to take the long road? When you just enter fake copy in rapid-fire fashion, you don't know what it really feels like to fill out that form. Do as your customers do and you'll understand them better.
